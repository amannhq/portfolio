just shipped this portfolio site. here's what i learned along the way. ⚡

## design decisions

i wanted something that felt like a terminal but wasn't cosplaying as one. the key was:

- **monospace font everywhere** — geist mono is beautiful
- **limited color palette** — mostly grays, orange for emphasis
- **no images** — text-first, content-focused
- **generous whitespace** — let things breathe

## astro is great

if you're building a content-heavy site, astro is probably the right choice:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

what i love:

- zero javascript by default
- mdx support out of the box
- fast builds
- simple mental model

## what's next

some things i want to add:

1. **dark mode** — respect system preferences ✅
2. **rss feed** — for the few who still use readers
3. **search** — once there's enough content

but for now, shipping beats perfecting.

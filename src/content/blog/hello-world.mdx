welcome to my corner of the internet. 👋

## why write?

i've been building things on the web for a while now, and i realized i learn best when i write things down. this blog is my attempt to:

- **document what i learn** — future me will thank present me
- **share useful things** — if it helped me, maybe it helps you too
- **think more clearly** — writing forces you to actually understand something

## what to expect

i'll mostly write about:

- web development (the frontend and backend kind)
- developer tools and workflows
- things i'm building and learning

no schedule, no pressure. just notes from the journey.

## the stack

this site is built with [astro](https://astro.build) — a modern static site generator that ships minimal javascript. the design is intentionally minimal, inspired by terminal aesthetics and notion's clean approach.

> simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

let's see where this goes.
